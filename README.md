Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the creation of of app through various avenues such as coding so as to solve problems. SOftware engineering is important in the technology industry as it helps solve complex problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programing language
2. Growth of software engineering as a profession
3. Adoption of agile approach in software development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Gather information about an issue/ problem,
2. Design of architecture and interface
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Agile is the iterative and incremental approach while the waterfall is the sequential approach.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
*A software developer is in charge of writting the code
*A quality assurance engineers is in charge of ensuring quality
*A project manager is in charge of planning and execution of a software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
*IDE's are softwares such as visual studio that allow for the writing of codes
* VCS are softwares such as github that allow for tracking of changes in software developments

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
*Software engineers are faced with changes in initial design- to overcome this they need to clearly understand and agree on what is expected of them,
* Deadlines- to do this they need to communicate clearly how much time they need to deliver on aa project

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
*Unit testing: is the testing of the various components of a software individualy- this is aimed at ensuring that the unit works properly
* Intergration testing: It is the testing of the various individual units and how they interact when put together,
* System testing: is the testing of the entire software to ensure that it is working as expected
* Acceptance testing: Is the measuring of the entire project agaisnt expectations

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the act of seeking information through questions and other avenues such as observation so as to come up with an ideal software. Interacting with AI enables a software engineer fill gaps that they may not be aware off. In this case use of AI tools such as Gemini, ChatGPT among others they are able to understand further what they need to deliver on.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt might be a prompt such as help me come up with a code for a software. In order to get the best answer it is essential to give specific queries such as help me come up with a code for a software that does e commerce with option for a customer filling up thier customer details, location and what they are pucrgasing, the code should have provision for a catalogues and deliver address as well as payment channels that include, Credit Card, Cheque and Cash as well as other digital forms such as m-pesa.
